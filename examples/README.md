# Examples

Mintpool can be used as either a library or a binary. When using it as a library you can do things
like add API routes to support different query patterns, and rules to modify which messages your
node stores.

To run examples you can use cargo, ex:

```shell
cargo run --example extra_rules_and_routes
```
